UForm
=====

UForm is a refactoring of the phalcon\Form component. It's a library to manage html forms and php validation easily and with high extendability.

**The idea** : The Phalcon component was good, butsome thing were not good or missing. For instance it was very difficult to implement group or collection of form elements. The rendering, validation and filtering have also been refactored
