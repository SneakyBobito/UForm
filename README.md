UForm is a form validation/filtering/rendering library that solve all the problems you encounter with web forms.

Why another form library ? Because the other I tryed had limitations. This library is an effort to make something more flexible and at the 
same time very concrete. 

Why concrete ? Because a form library should be as simple as possible in many aspects : creation, validation, data binding, rendering, etc...

Top Features
------------

- Fluent form builder to make form creation as painless as possible
- Structure aware form : you can structure your inputs in columns, tabs, panels... with no impact of the data processing
- Flexible and extensible rendering : you are free to you the native html render, the bootstrap render, 
the foundation render, or to write your one render from scratch or by extending an existing one.
